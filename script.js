Every week he walked from his village to the Church of Santiago in the city to attend mass and praise God with the great company.<br/><br/>On the 9th of December he set out as usual before dawn, wrapping his tilma about him for warmth. But this day as Juan Diego neared the hill of Tepeyac, he heard singing. A brilliant cloud covered the top of the hill. Juan Diego went closer, and the cloud seemed to explode in a rainbow of color.<br/><br/>Then a gentle woman’s voice spoke to him in his native language: “Juan, Juan Diego.” Juan Diego ran to the top of the hill. As he reached the summit, the cloud parted, and he saw the most beautiful woman dressed in the robes of an Indian princess.<br/><br/>Lights shone out in rays around her. “Juan Diego,” said the woman, “smallest and most beloved of my song. I am the Mother of God. Go to the bishop at the great church; tell him I’ve sent you. Tell him I want a church built where I can show my love to your people.”<br/><br/>Juan Diego saw the Lady stood on a crescent moon held by an angel with colored wings. He fell to the ground and covered his head with his tilma.<br/><br/>“My son,” said the Lady in a gentle voice, “climb to the top of the hill. Cut and gather the roses there. Collect them in your tilma and bring them to the bishop. THis is the sign he needs to believe I have spoken to you.”<br/><br/>Juan Diego ran to the top of the hill, and there, though it was winter, was a beautiful garden of Roses of Castile. Juan Diego filled his tilma with them and ran to the Church of Santiago.<br/><br/>When he arrived, he opened his tilma and poured out the fresh red blooms before the bishop. A cry came from the bishop as Juan Diego stood holding his empty tilma.<br/><br/>The bishop stared not at the roses, but at Juan Diego’s empty tilma. Imprinted there on his rough cactus fiber cloak was a painting of the Mother of God just as Juan Diego had seen her at Tepeyac.<br/><br/>A church to Our Lady of Guadalupe was built at Tepeyac, and Juan Diego made its caretaker. His tilma with its miraculous image is still there over 400 years later.<div class='entrySource'>—the story of Our Lady of Guadalupe, as told by Tomie dePaola</div>"
